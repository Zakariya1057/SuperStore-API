                  <p><strong>English</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Privacy Policy SuperStore GmbH</strong></p>
                  <p>We, SuperStore GmbH, Dessauer Str. 28-29, 10963 Berlin, are committed to protecting privacy of users of the SuperStore website, SuperStore application(s), and/or other related services (hereinafter collectively the “SuperStore Services” or the “Services”).</p>
                  <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, SuperStore GmbH is the “data controller” for all SuperStore Services.</p>
                  <p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal data we collect and how we use such data. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy is part of our General Terms and Conditions and applies to all SuperStore Services. Therefore, please make sure that you read and understand our Privacy Policy, as well as the General Terms and Conditions.</p>
                  <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they may be accessible through the SuperStore Services.</p>
                  <p>By using any of the SuperStore Services, you hereby warrant and represent that (i) you have read, understand and agree to this Privacy Policy, (ii) you are over 16 years of age (or are a parent or guardian with such authority to agree to this Privacy Policy for the benefit of an individual who is under 16 years of age). If you do not accept the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy and the consents associated therewith, please do not use our Services.</p>
                  <p>Last revised: December 2018</p>
                  <p><strong>1. What types and categories of data we collect, process and use?</strong></p>
                  <p>We collect, process and use personal and non-personal data.</p>
                  <p><strong>1.1 Personal and non-personal data</strong></p>
                  <p>The term “personal data” is defined by the Federal Data Protection Act (<em>BDSG</em>) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (<em>GDPR</em>). You can think of your personal data as any data that allow you to be identified or that can be correlated to you.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, “non-personal” data cannot be correlated to any specific person. By removing identifiable parts from and anonymizing personal data, personal data may be converted into “non-personal data.”</p>
                  <p><strong>1.2 Data we collect, process and use</strong></p>
                  <p>We collect, process and use three types of data:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>data you provide to us voluntarily,</li>
                     <li>data we receive when you use our Services, and</li>
                     <li>data we receive from third parties.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Typically, we collect, process and use the following categories of data:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>your name and address;</li>
                     <li>your personal contact information (telephone, e-mail, fax, etc.);</li>
                     <li>your username and password;</li>
                     <li>your user profile data (e.g., workout schedule);</li>
                     <li>your user preferences (e.g., preferred language settings);</li>
                     <li>your IP address, operating system, browser type, browser version, browser configuration, name of Internet provider, and any other relevant information regarding your computer and Internet connection in order to identify the type of your device, to connect you to the website, to exchange data with your (mobile) terminal device, or to ensure proper use of the website and an SuperStore application;</li>
                     <li>the URL and IP address of the website from which you access our website or from which you are transferred to our website, including date and time;</li>
                     <li>any pages of our website on which you click during your visit, and any links on our website on which you click, including date and time;</li>
                     <li>the entire Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream regarding, through, and from the website, including date and time;</li>
                     <li>your service inquiries and your orders;</li>
                     <li>your transaction history, including open and completed transactions;</li>
                     <li>search terms you input in relation to or within our Services;</li>
                     <li>information regarding your orders and payments;</li>
                     <li>information collected by cookies or similar technologies (as explained below);</li>
                     <li>your survey answers, critiques, evaluations, or other responses;</li>
                     <li>the content of all messages sent through the website or an SuperStore application, including information uploaded to social networks through the website or an SuperStore application or otherwise shared with us and/or other users, as well as chat messages and chat logs;</li>

                     <li>any other information input or uploaded by you through the website or an SuperStore application (e.g., information you provide when completing an online form, photos you upload); or</li>
                     <li>data we receive when you log in through social media (e.g., if you log in with Facebook).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>2. How is data collected?</strong></p>
                  <p>Personal data is collected by us only if you provide such data to us on your own initiative by choosing to use our Services. To be able to use our Services, you must register your account with us.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.1 Login</strong></p>
                  <p>You may create an SuperStore user account through our login system. Following registration, you will be able to use your user account to subscribe to all SuperStore Services. To register, you must provide us with at least the following information:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>first and last name,</li>
                     <li>e-mail address, and</li>
                     <li>password</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Before completing the registration process, you must confirm that you have read our Privacy Policy and accept our General Terms and Conditions.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.2 Adding information to your user profile</strong></p>
                  <p>SuperStore application(s) also enable you to provide us with additional information, such as your gender, fitness level, and workout goals. After registering, you can add more information to your profile (e.g., a profile photo). If you do so, you will once again provide us with personal data. We will also receive data (including personal data) from you when you communicate with us or other users through an SuperStore application. If you create a workout schedule, we will receive information about which and how many workouts you have completed. We will also receive information about how you use SuperStore application(s). In that case, too, you will provide us with personal data.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.3 Enabling access rights to your device</strong></p>
                  <p>For you to be able to use an SuperStore application to the full extent, we will also need certain access rights to your smart phone. For example, we need access to your camera or your photos if you upload or want to change a profile photo. We use push messages to send you workout reminders or to notify you of new followers or comments. When you want to use such a function for the first time, we will ask you whether you grant us such access rights or we will ask you to grant us access by selecting the appropriate settings. Generally, you may revoke such access rights at any time by changing the appropriate settings.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.4 Newsletter</strong></p>
                  <p>You can register for our newsletter. That way, you will receive regular updates about the SuperStore Services. All you need to receive our newsletter is to provide us with a valid e-mail address. If you are no longer interested in receiving the newsletter, you may unsubscribe at any time using the link that is included in each newsletter.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.5 Linking your account to Facebook</strong></p>
                  <p>You can also link your SuperStore user account to your Facebook profile. To do so, simply choose “Login with Facebook” during the registration process; you will then be transferred to Facebook. There, you will be shown to which Facebook data we will receive access. We will store your Facebook e-mail address. This is the e-mail address we will use to contact you, if necessary. We will also record the fact that you have registered through Facebook.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.6 Website</strong></p>
                  <p>You will also transfer certain information to us when you access our website or SuperStore application(s), e.g., your IP address. We will also receive data about which terminal device (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) you are using, which browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.) you are using, the time at which you access the website, the so-called referrer, and the data volume transferred. Such data cannot be used by us to identify the user. This data is processed for statistical purposes only. Such analyses help us make our Services more attractive and, if necessary, to improve our Services.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.7 Log files</strong></p>
                  <p>Every time you access our website the aforementioned data will be automatically stored in log files. A log file automatically logs all or defined actions on a computer system. Such log files are important, for example, for process control and automation. In the case of databases a log file tracks changes to the database of correctly executed transactions. In the event of an error (e.g., a system crash), this allows the current dataset to be restored. Log files are also created by web servers.&nbsp;<em>Inter alia</em>, the following data are logged: the address of the accessing computer, authentication fields, date and time of access, access method, content of HTML access, status code of the web server, and information about the browser and operating system used by the client.</p>
                  <p><strong>2.8 Other possible instances of data collection</strong></p>
                  <p>Collection of data also happens, for example, when you contact us or other users, i.e., when you open your SuperStore user account, sign up for a subscription, upload a profile photo, or use our Services to send messages.</p>
                  <p><strong>3. What are our legal bases for processing of your data?</strong></p>
                  <p>We will collect, process, and use your personal data and other data to support the delivery of SuperStore Services in accordance with our General Terms and Conditions. &nbsp;In this section we provide information on the legal basis for our processing of your Personal Data as required by Art. 13 and 14 of the GDPR, as well as provide detailed information about the purposes of collection, processing and use of your data.</p>

                  <p>We may also process the data if it is necessary to protect vital interests of our users and/or other people, or for the performance of an obligation to carry out in the public interest pursuant to Art. 6(1) (d) and (e).</p>
                  <p><strong>4. What do we use your data for (purposes of processing)?</strong></p>

We also use data that are collected automatically on our website or through the SuperStore application.
